# ImposterAI: Multi-Agent Social Deduction Engine
ImposterAI is a real-time, LLM-powered social deduction game where players must identify a hidden AI "Imposter" among human participants. This engine utilizes a Stateful Game Manager and Persona-Conditioned Logic to simulate strategic deception and human-like interaction patterns.

Technical Overview
Building on experience with NLP-powered parsers and real-time interactive systems, this project explores the boundary between human and machine communication. The system manages concurrent user sessions while orchestrating an AI participant that must defend itself against human suspicion by analyzing conversation history and adapting its tone.

Key Technical Pillars
Stateful Game Orchestration: A centralized GameManager handles secret role assignment (Imposter vs. Crewmate) and transitions between Discussion and Voting phases.

Agentic Inference Layer: Powered by the Gemini API, the AI agent performs reasoning based on its assigned role and personality (e.g., Defensive, Accusatory, or Casual).

Real-Time Bi-directional Communication: Built on FastAPI WebSockets to ensure sub-50ms message latency and synchronized game states across all clients.

Human-Like Interaction: Implements asynchronous Thinking Delays and natural language variation to increase the difficulty of AI detection.

Responsive Game UI: A dark-themed interface built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS, featuring live system notifications and role-specific views.

Tech Stack
Backend: Python, FastAPI, WebSockets

AI Engine: Google Gemini Pro (LLM)

Frontend: Next.js 14, React, Tailwind CSS

Data & Cache: Redis (Message Queuing), MongoDB (Game History)

Infrastructure: Docker, Vercel (CI/CD)

System Architecture
The system follows a micro-interaction pattern where the server maintains the source of truth:

WebSocket Handshake: Clients connect and are assigned a unique client_id.

Role Assignment: Once the required number of players join, the GameEngine randomly selects an Imposter.

Context Injection: Every AI response is generated by injecting the last 10 chat messages as context, allowing the bot to maintain conversational memory.

Voting Logic: Structured JSON payloads allow for a hidden voting phase where results are revealed simultaneously.

Future Roadmap
Audio-Based Detection: Integrating research in Audio-Based Object Detection to allow for voice-stress analysis during voting phases.

Bias-Aware Moderation: Implementing a safety layer to prevent LLM hallucination or toxicity in high-intensity rounds.

Kubernetes Scaling: Orchestrating multiple concurrent game rooms using Kubernetes for high availability.
